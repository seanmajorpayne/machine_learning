# Linear Regression

## About this Repo

The two folders here contain a series of linear regression models coded exclusively in Numpy.
The sample exercises demonstrate basic concepts (regularization, gradient descent) on
contrived data. This is my own code, but the exercises stem from classes by the Lazy Programmer. The real world tests are multi-dimensional datasets taken from Houghton Mifflin, which are ideal for linear regression.

This README also contains an overview of the theory behind linear regression.

## What is linear regression?
