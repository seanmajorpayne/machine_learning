# Facial Recognition

## Data Source

Data for this project was grabbed from an older kaggle competition located here.
This data is required to run this program.

## Project Goal

This project helped expand my knowledge of how to implement machine learning algorithms
as classes, similar to the sklearn format. This also introduced me to working with images
in matplotlib.

One of insights I gained working on this project is that all data is relatively similar.
Despite being a collection of images, they are still dealt with in the same way that any
other data is handled.

## Functionality
